I  might have to change "SelectableOptionButton" as I build the onClick functionality 


TODO

  Add validation in URLField (similar to EmailField)
    Fix changing Icon as well

  Re-do all spacing/layout (REM)
    DONE Convert all PX to REM
    Fix Textbox multi-line issue (want the input to be aligned to top, and for the box to dynamically resize vertically)

  DONE Clean up Selected Button CSS (SelectableOptionButton) because it's adding vertical space on the border when it's active

  DONE (email form added to main page) (First Page) Clean up Email Address Submit button (Put the submit functionality within the "Next" Button)

  *Clean-up Close Button (use CloseButton2 now) (wtf is going on here Matt)

  *Database

  *Backend

  *Login

  *Authentication (Email, URL, Description)
